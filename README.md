# diabetes-prediction-machinelearning-with-8-models


<br/>

This repository is a comprehensive implementation of machine learning algorithms designed for accurate diabetes prediction. It utilizes a diverse set of eight models, including Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest, K-Nearest Neighbors, AdaBoost Classifier, Gradient Boosting Classifier, XGBoost Classifier, and ExtraTrees Classifier. These models work collectively to predict the occurrence of diabetes in individuals based on various input features.

To ensure reliable evaluation metrics, the dataset has been appropriately split into training and testing sets, with 80% of the data allocated for training the models and 20% for evaluation. This division allows for thorough testing and validation of the model's performance.

The project also employs the powerful visualization capabilities of Matplotlib. Through visually appealing plots, the repository provides insights into the dataset itself, as well as the performance of the models. Additionally, the Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curve is utilized as an evaluation metric. This curve visually represents the trade-off between true positive and false positive rates, aiding in the understanding of the predictive power and accuracy of the implemented algorithms.
